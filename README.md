# Space Biology Knowledge Engine 🚀

![Project Logo](https://github.com/fatimaelkashef280-art/Space-biology-knowledge-engine/blob/main/logo.png)

This project was created for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**.  
Our goal is to build a functional **knowledge engine** that helps summarize, connect, and visualize insights from over **600 NASA space biology publications**.  

---

## 🌍 Problem
NASA has a vast number of bioscience experiments and publications, but the insights are scattered across multiple repositories.  
Scientists, managers, and mission planners need a tool to easily explore **progress, knowledge gaps, risks, and actionable insights**.

---

## 💡 Solution
We propose an **interactive dashboard** powered by:
- **AI Summarization** → Extract key findings from Results & Conclusions.  
- **Knowledge Graphs** → Link related experiments, species, and outcomes.  
- **Smart Search & Filters** → Quickly find studies by topic, organism, or mission.  
- **Visual Analytics** → Highlight trends, consensus areas, and open questions.

## 👥 Target Audience
- Scientists generating new hypotheses  
- Managers identifying investment opportunities  
- Mission planners preparing for Moon and Mars exploration  

---

## 📊 Features
- Summaries of 600+ NASA space biology publications  
- Graph-based exploration of related experiments  
- Interactive filtering by study type, organism, and outcomes  
- Clear visualization of research progress and knowledge gaps

## 📌 Next Steps
1. Build a working prototype dashboard.  
2. Expand summaries using NLP models.  
3. Connect live to NASA repositories for continuous updates.
